# Objective: 
The aim of the project is to analyze and visualize employee attrition within the company and identify factors that contribute to attrition.

# Data Analysis: 
Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis to understand attrition patterns, salary disparities, educational backgrounds, age groups, experience levels, and the impact of business travel on attrition.

# Dashboard Creation: 
Developed a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau to present the analysis findings visually and intuitively.

# Summary
1.**Attrition Rates:** Determined that the overall attrition rate in the company is 16.16%, with the highest attrition observed in the Sales department (20.72%), followed by Human Resources (19.05%), and the lowest in the Technology department (13.85%).

2.**Salary Disparity:** Identified a significant gap between minimum and maximum salaries, with the majority of employees falling within the 20k-110k salary range. This salary range also experienced the highest attrition.

3. **Job Roles:** Discovered that data scientists, software engineers, sales executives, and sales representatives had the highest attrition rates, indicating dissatisfaction within these specific roles.

4. **Educational Background:** Noted that employees with technical degrees had the highest attrition rate (32%), followed by marketing (20%). HR employees with an HR background had a 26% attrition rate, and business studies employees in the Technology department had a 21% attrition rate.

5. **Age and Experience:** Found that a significant proportion of attrition occurred in the younger age group (20s), with employees in the early years of their careers (0-5 years) showing higher attrition rates.

6. **Business Travel:** Uncovered a correlation between business travel and attrition, with employees who had some travel having the highest attrition rate (66%), followed by frequent travelers (29%).

# Recommendations: 
Based on the analysis, provided recommendations for the organization to take action and implement strategies to retain more employees, focusing on areas such as salary disparities, job satisfaction, and addressing challenges related to business travel.

# Conclusion:
This project involved in-depth analysis, visualization, and interpretation of employee attrition data, highlighting key insights and providing actionable recommendations to help the organization address attrition and improve employee retention.

# Limitations
1. **Department-Specific Analysis**: The dashboard focuses on three departments (Sales, Technology, and Human Resources), which may not represent the entire organization.
2. **Self-Learning Approach** : Since this project is self-learned, there might be limitations in terms of industry standards, best practices, and advanced analytical techniques
